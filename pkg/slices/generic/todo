Ripe for performance improvement
Any <- Can do a parallel search, splitting the list into chunks, each scanned by a different channel
Count <- Can be split and counted in parallel
Difference <- currently has a minor optimiation to only scan the shorter list. However, other strategies could improve performance quite a bit.
Group <- internal hashing is really naive. Could be optimized if hashes were sorted.
Intersection <- Currently uses Any() to determine if an element has already been added. This has a low memory overhead, but a huge performance pentalty. A better approach would be to store the matches in a map then convert the map to a slice in a single pass.
